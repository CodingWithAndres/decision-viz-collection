## Overview

This project explores visualization as a decision-support system.

Instead of focusing on domain strategies (e.g., trading methods), it analyzes how **visual structure — hierarchy, color, layout, and interaction — shapes interpretation and cognitive load**.

Each source is fully annotated with:

- Summary  
- Practical value  
- Intended audience  
- Limitations  

The collection is organized into four sections:

- Visualization Principles & Theory  
- Dashboards & Interface Design  
- Tools & Platforms  
- Visual Communication & Storytelling
